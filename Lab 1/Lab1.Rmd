### Load the CDC dataset
```{r}
source("more/cdc.R")
```

1.  How many cases are there in this data set?  How many variables?  For each 
    variable, identify its data type (e.g. categorical, discrete).

```{r}
dim(cdc)
```

Each row is a case, and each column is a variable, so there are 20000 cases and 9 variables.

We first get the variable names:
```{r}
names(cdc)
```

  * genhlth  = Categorical (ordinal). It's not numeric, and there are different levels.
  * exerany  = Categorical (nominal). It's a binary question, and there aren't levels, i.e. 1 isn't better/higher than 0.
  * hlthplan = Categorical (nominal). ibid.
  * smoke100 = Categorical (nominal). ibid.
  * height   = Numerical (discrete). Since it records it inches, and assuming there can't be fractions, it gives an exact number.
  * weight   = Numerical (discrete). ibid.
  * wtdesire = Numerical (discrete). ibid.
  * age      = Numerical (discrete). ibid.
  * gender   = Categorical (nominal). Same reason as the other nominals.
  
2.  Create a numerical summary for `height` and `age`, and compute the 
    interquartile range for each. Compute the relative frequency distribution for
    `gender` and `exerany`. How many males are in the sample? What proportion of
    the sample reports being in excellent health?

```{r}
summary(cdc$height)
```

The interquartile range for `height` is
```{r eval=TRUE}
70 - 64
```

```{r}
summary(cdc$age)
```

The interquartile range for `age` is
```{r eval=TRUE}
57 - 31
```

The relative frequency for `gender` is
```{r}
table(cdc$gender)/20000
```

The relative frequency for `exerany` is
```{r}
table(cdc$exerany)/20000
```

The number of males in the sample is
```{r}
table(cdc$gender)
```
9569.

```{r}
table(cdc$genhlth)
```

Since excellent is the first column, we can run the following command to get the proportion

```{r}
table(cdc$genhlth)[1]/20000
```
~23.3% of the sample reported being in excellent overall health.

3.  What does the mosaic plot reveal about smoking habits and gender?

```{r fig.align = "center"}
mosaicplot(table(cdc$gender, cdc$smoke100))
```

We can see that more males than females reported having smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.

4.  Create a new object called `under23_and_smoke` that contains all observations 
    of respondents under the age of 23 that have smoked 100 cigarettes in their 
    lifetime. Write the command you used to create the new object as the answer
    to this exercise.

```{r}
under23_and_smoke <- subset(cdc, age < 23 & smoke100 == "1")
nrow(under23_and_smoke)
```
There are 620 people that match these criteria.

4.  What does this box plot show? Pick another categorical variable from the 
    data set and see how it relates to BMI. List the variable you chose, why you
    might think it would have a relationship to BMI,  and indicate what the 
    figure seems to suggest. 

```{r fig.align = "center"}
bmi <- (cdc$weight / cdc$height^2) * 703
boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$genhlth)
```
We can see that `bmi` is inversely correlated with reported health condition.

I would imagine that `bmi` would also be negatively correlated with `exerany`. To check, we can enter
```{r fig.align = "center"}
boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$exerany)
```
Aside from a few outliers, we can see that this is indeed the case.

## On Your Own

1.  Make a scatterplot of weight versus desired weight. Describe the 
    relationship between these two variables.
    
We can plot this using
```{r fig.align = "center"}
plot(cdc$weight, cdc$wtdesire)
```
There is a positive correlation between weight and desired weight. That is, the desired weight of those with a higher weight is higher than those with a lower weight.

2.  Let's consider a new variable: the difference between desired weight 
    (`wtdesire`) and current weight (`weight`). Create this new variable by 
    subtracting the two columns in the data frame and assigning them to a new 
    object called `wdiff`.
    
```{r}
wdiff <- (cdc$wtdesire - cdc$weight)
```

3.  What type of data is `wdiff`? If an observation `wdiff` is 0, what does 
    this mean about the person's weight and desired weight. What if `wdiff` is 
    positive or negative?
    
Assuming that we only record integers (round to the nearest lb/kg), then `wdiff` is a Numerical (discrete) variable.
If `wdiff` is 0, then the person is at their desired weight. 
If `wdiff` is x < 0, then the person wants to lose x lbs/kgs.
If `wdiff` is x > 0, then the person wants to gain x lbs/kgs.

4.  Describe the distribution of `wdiff` in terms of its center, shape, and 
    spread, including any plots you use. What does this tell us about how people 
    feel about their current weight?
    
First, let's get a summary
```{r}
summary(wdiff)
```
And a few graphs
```{r fig.align = "center"}
boxplot(wdiff)
hist(wdiff)
hist(wdiff, breaks = 100)
```

The vast majority are close to their ideal weight, with a few extreme cases. The average amount of weight people want to lose is ~14.5 lbs/kgs.

5.  Using numerical summaries and a side-by-side box plot, determine if men tend
    to view their weight differently than women.

We'll start by isolating each gender, finding their respective `wdiff`, listing a summary of each, and, finally, plotting `wdiff` respective to each gender.
```{r fig.align = "center"}
# I looked up how to better specify what I want from the subset function (?subset), and was able to perform the following.
mwdiff <- subset(cdc, gender == "m", select = c(wtdesire, weight))
summary(mwdiff)
summary(mwdiff$wtdesire - mwdiff$weight)
fwdiff <- subset(cdc, gender == "f", select = c(wtdesire, weight))
summary(fwdiff)
summary(fwdiff$wtdesire - fwdiff$weight)
boxplot(wdiff ~ cdc$gender, ylim = c(-75,75))
```

From the tables and graphs, it's evident that men are closer to their ideal weight, while women prefer to lose more weight. 

Note: I limited the y-axis so that the plot will be zoomed in, and to remove the influence of the few outliers on each side.

6.  Now it's time to get creative. Find the mean and standard deviation of 
    `weight` and determine what proportion of the weights are within one 
    standard deviation of the mean.
    
```{r}
# Get an overall summary, including the mean
summary(cdc$weight)
# Function to get the sd
sd(cdc$weight)
cweight = cdc$weight
# I found the inner function to determine data within 1 sd on Stack Overflow. I repurposed it for my own needs, and then used the NROW function to determine the number of pieces of data fall within that 1 sd.
withinOne <- NROW(cweight[abs(cweight - mean(cweight)) <= sd(cweight)])
# To find the proportion, simply divide by the sample size, i.e. 20000
withinOne / 20000
```
